# Exhausting A Crowd

Inspired by the classic 60-page piece of experimental literature from Georges Perec, “An Attempt at Exhausting a Place in Paris”, written from a bench over three days in 1974. “Exhausting a Crowd” will automate the task of completely describing the events of three days in a busy public space. This work speaks to the potential of a perfectly automated future of surveillance, enabled by a distributed combination of machine and human intelligence. A beautiful record of the energy present in shared space, as well as a disturbing look into the potential for control in a dystopian environment.

Commissioned by the V&A for "[All of This Belongs to You](http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/exhibitions/all-of-this-belongs-to-you/)", when it opens, the site will also go live, with the process of categorization and description happening in real time. Visitors to the site will label activities, individuals, themes, patterns, the site will update with a visualization for visitors to explore.
